# About the project

This project solves no problems, it is purely a collection of demos mentioned in my post. All the code is tested locally and performed well, but I take no guarantee they will work well when you pasted pieces to your own project.  

THEREFORE, I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN YOU MISUSED MY CODE TO YOUR OWN PROJECT.

All the contents involved in this project, contains program basic algorithms, digital image processing algorithms, AI based on PyTorch, machine learning, etc.

They are actually summaries of my experience and the samples extracted from various textbooks. 

So the best way for you to enhance understanding is when you confused with some concepts, read the code and run the samples, and try to reimplement the algorithm with yourself.

I might, in the future, translate my blog postes to English and place those postes to the project. However, the reason for not doing so is I have few time, and currently is still sorting out and writing the postes.

Alternatively, if you know Chinese, you can follow my CSDN blog, the content involved in the project, you can find the corresponding explanation in my post.

Or you have any questions, please open an Github issue to ask.
